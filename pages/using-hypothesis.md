[Hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is/about/) is “a conversation layer over the entire web that works everywhere, without needing implementation by any underlying site.” Integrating Hypothesis with an AudiAnnotate project allows for a layer of commentary on top of AudiAnnotate annotations from multiple contributors. When annotating with Hypothesis, you can annotate in a group, individually, privately, or publicly.
