### Part 1: Selecting Audio or Video
- AudiAnnotate supports direct links to audio or video (the url will typically end in .mp3 or .mp4). You can also use audio or video uploaded to Internet Archive (with a direct link) and audio hosted on the cloud software Wasabi. Spokenweb audio also works!
- Be mindful of the media you choose. Add a content warning if appropriate, provide a summary, and provide context.
- Think about questions and discussions you might prompt in order to scaffold critical thinking and understanding of the chosen media


### Part 2: Setting up Your Classroom Project

1. You will need to have a GitHub account. To create an account on GitHub:
- Navigate to GitHub.
- You will provide a username, email address, and password to create your GitHub account.

2. Navigate to the AudiAnnotate Application (AA).
You will be prompted to log in through GitHub. (Make sure to allow the app to authorize AA. This means that AA will be allowed to manage and write files on your behalf. )
- Enter your GitHub password to log in.
3. Select “New Project.” On this page, you will add the metadata to allow AA to generate your project. AA creates a repository or “repo” in GitHub, which is your project’s storage space for any files related to your project.
- Add a “Title.” This is the project name, and the name of the GitHub repository that will be generated in this process. This title will also appear as the project name on the AA site under “My Projects.”
- Add a description of your project.
- Add a project slug. This becomes the GitHub repository url. Note, spaces are not recognized. Please use hyphens instead of spaces.
4. Select “Create Project.”This contacts GitHub and generates the repository. Now you have created an AudiAnnotate project, with all information stored in a GitHub repository. The next step will be to build the IIIF Manifest, which allows you to associate audiovisual material and annotations with your project.
