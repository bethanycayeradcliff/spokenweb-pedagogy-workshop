### **Step 1: Selecting Audio or Video**<a name="one"></a>
- AudiAnnotate supports direct links to audio or video (the url will typically end in .mp3 or .mp4). You can also use audio or video uploaded to Internet Archive (with a direct link) and audio hosted on the cloud software Wasabi. Spokenweb audio also works!
- Be mindful of the media you choose and the audience it will have (both in the classroom and online). Add a content warning if appropriate, provide a summary, and provide context.
- Think about questions and discussions you might prompt in order to scaffold critical thinking and understanding of the chosen media.


### **Step 2: Setting up Your Classroom Project and Adding Your Audiovisual Item(s)**<a name="two"></a>

The AudiAnnotate application uses GitHub to access data and build project repositories. It does not store data, but rather, allows you to interact easily with data in GitHub through our application interface. To do this, AA creates a IIIF manifest that is stored in GitHub. This manifest includes the information you will provide when you build your project, upload a URL to an audiovisual item and associated metadata, and add annotation layers. 

Each project contains items. These items can present an audio or visual item (select "Create Item Manifest") or only text (select "New Page"). Before you create a project, you'll want to consider whether you want to share your project with the students for them to upload their annotations themselves, or whether you'll manage uploading annotations without student invovlement.

To create a project and add items: 

1. Navigate to the AudiAnnotate Application (AA) and log in.
2. Create a project by selecting "New Project" and entering in the required information.
- Here, a project can be organized around a topic ("WWII Speeches," "Maggie Nelson Poems"), a class activity ("Analyzing Maya Deren's <em>At Land</em>," "Listening Activity"), a group ("Group 1 Annotations," "Tanya, Bethany, and Kylie"), etc.
3. Add an audio or visual item by selecting "Create Item Manifest," or add a page by selecting "New Page." For audiovisual items, you'll need at least a direct link to the item and the audiovisual item's duration to create the item in the project. 
- Here, you may want to consider organizing your items around topics ("Rhetorical Appeals," "Context for Recordings" or "Poems about Identity," "Context for Readings"), a class activity ("Identifying Rhetorical Appeals," "Effect on Audience"), a group ("Group 1 Annotations," "Tanya, Bethany, and Kylie"), etc.
4.  Select "Save."
 
### **Step 3: Creating and Uploading Annotations**<a name="three"></a>

Annotations for AudiAnnotate need to be formatted in seconds and organized by columns.
 - Our [formatted google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ImjhjLD1g-lQulJX3UJe4Y91z04EOriYCqiN1rz9gnw/copy?usp=sharing) is a great resource to share with your students.
 - Annotations can be easily created in Google Sheets or Excel. Students can work in groups or individually, then download the file as a .tsv, .csv, or .xlsx. 
 - If you have added students to the GitHub project, they can upload to the shared project on their own. If not, they can share their annotation files with you, and you can upload them.
